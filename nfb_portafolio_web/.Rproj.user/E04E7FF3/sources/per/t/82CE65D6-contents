  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    I have a background in the sciences and have gained experience in industry, academic research, and teaching. Working with <strong>data</strong>, from experimental design to raw information to insights, is a crucial part of a scientist’s duties. My goal is to work as a <strong>Data Scientist</strong> in the technological, commercial, financial, biomedical, and governance sectors, and elevate my career to the next level.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I am confident that the scientific, analytical, critical, and lifelong-learning mindset that I’ve developed over nearly 17 years of studying and working in chemistry, often referred to as the central science, will be helpful for <strong>solving problems</strong> and <strong>generating value</strong> across various fields and interdisciplinary teams.
