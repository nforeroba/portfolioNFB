      For my master's thesis, I developed a Homeland Security AI Q&A application. It transforms your natural language question about Colombian crime statistics into a SQLite query whose result is displayed as a table or plotly chart. It uses ChatGPT-4x models for inference, LangChain and LangGraph for orchestration and Streamlit for the web interface.
